# srtools
Utilities for LEGO Stunt Rally (LSR).

### Note: The code in this repository is very awful and has been archived, as it is very awful and has been superceded by [LSRutil.NET](https://github.com/YellowberryHN/LSRutil.NET). 

## Utilities

### gentrack.py

A tool to generate a LSR .trk file. Should only be considered a proof-of-concept.
